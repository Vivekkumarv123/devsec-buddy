# DevSec Buddy

**DevSec Buddy** is a full-stack web vulnerability scanner designed to help developers identify and fix common website security issues like CSRF, XSS, missing security headers, and more.

This project consists of a **frontend** built with Next.js and a **backend** powered by Node.js and Python. The system offers real-time scans, security scores, vulnerability insights, and detailed remediation guidance using a sleek, modern interface.

## Frontend Setup

1. Clone the frontend:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsec-buddy-frontend.git
   cd devsec-buddy/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. Run the dev server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the backend:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsec-buddy.git
   cd devsec-buddy/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and your `scanner/main.py` script is ready.

4. Start the dev server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoint

### POST `/api/scan`

Trigger a security scan with optional configuration.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "url": "https://target-site.com",
  "profile": "basic",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": { "username": "admin" },
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer token" },
  "cookies": { "session": "abc123" }
}
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "vulnerabilities": [...],
    "summary": { "score": 72, "severity": "medium" }
  }
}
```

## Render Cold Start Optimization

For backend hosted on Render, the frontend auto-pings:

```js
if (input.url.includes("devsec-buddy-backend.onrender.com")) {
  await axios.get("https://devsec-buddy-backend.onrender.com/healthz");
}
```

This reduces the wait time from cold starts.
